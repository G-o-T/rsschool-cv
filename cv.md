##About me\
I'm a lawyer who is fed up with ordinary paper work and try to find some new sphere. Several month ago I was forced to create [site](http://fluidart.by/) for my hobby (fluid art painting) and fell in love with code. That's why I'm going to become Front-end Developer.

##Code example

let shortLink = () => {

  let result = [shortRegExp1, shortRegExp2];
  alert(result.join(''));
}

shortLink();
